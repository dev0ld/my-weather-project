# my-weather-project

This is a weather app that lets you search for a city and view current conditions. 

It fetches live data from the SheCodes Weather API, updates the UI dynamically with JavaScript, and is styled to be responsive across devices. 

*This project was built as part of the SheCodes Plus Week 5 homework*

## How it works

- Type a city name and submit the form.
- The app requests current weather data from the API using Axios.
- The temperature and date/time are rendered in the UI based on the response.

## Built with

- HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- Axios for API requests
- SheCodes Weather API
